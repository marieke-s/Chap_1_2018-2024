# Group samples by replicates : 

To avoid pseudo-replication and ensure independence of our observations, we pooled together samples occurring at the same site (within a 500m radius around the sampling transect), within the same 1/2 day (≤ 6h difference), at the same sampling depth (< 5m difference), with the same sampling method.

This definition allows to group together samples for which the extraction of MARS3D environmental variables will be virtually the same. It doesn't necessarily correspond to the replicates as they were intended in the field.

The replicates were first pooled together by Amandine Avouac: (see R scripts in /1_Replicates_pooling : extraction_replicates_mtd_Med.R and verif_replicates_distance.R) 

- same date, time, site name and duration
- when time was missing, using same site, subsite and date
- some projects were individually looked at to pool together replicates as intended on field
- replicates needed to be ≤ 1 km away. 

We then checked manually and modified the replicate's pooling to make sure they match the above definition. Full description of modifications is made here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MyAs5c67hBPmW2C0piZrX5Qr4XVLwduplSN-G7GwBFQ/edit?tab=t.0 (mail sent on 22/07/2025 to Amandine and Laure). These modifications are implemented in the   
1_Prep_Mtdt.R script at section # Replicates errors







# Subsets of samples : 

We remove of the full dataset samples uneeded for our study : 
- Selection of points sampled in France 
- Selection of marine points: outside harbours, lagoons, ports, rivers, estuaries 
- Filtering out the seamount, canyon and open_ocean samples
- Selection of coastal points : we want to remove samples far away from the coast, thus we keep all samples <3km away from the coast (samples with component = 'coastal') and 'offshore' samples with < 50m depth. This is because some 'offshore' samples are in fact very close to the shore. 

At least one sample within a replicate group must match these criteria for the all the samples of the replicate groups to be kept (i.e. we keep all samples of a replicate group if one matches the criteria even if the other samples do not match all criteria).






# Buffer : 
To take into account spatial uncertainty linked to were the transect occurred and eDNA signal dispersion, we apply a 500 meters around the replicate groups. To do so, we first compute 500 meters buffers around each sample transect (straight line between start and end point location). Then, we computed a concave hull to create a polygon thightly wrapping all the buffers of a replicate group.  







# Output : 
mtdt_2.gpkg
Per-sample buffers (500 m) with original per-sample attributes. 

mtdt_3.gpkg
Same rows as mtdt_2, but geometry is replicate-level hull when a replicate exists; otherwise the sample buffer. 

mtdt_4_date_time.csv
Minimal table of replicates, date, time_start.

mtdt_4.gpkg
Lightweight replicate-level geometry with only the essentials (date/time, country/region, depth_sampling). Intended for MARS3D extraction workflows (Pauline).

mtdt_5.gpkg
Full replicate-level dataset: geometry, harmonized metadata, plus totals (estimated_volume_total, duration_total) and combined comments. 

788 replicate groups
1667 samples

# Distances : 


# Distance to shore (Pauline / Marieke) :
Important methodological considerations : Distance to shore is computed from replicates group's buffer centroids. When a centroid is on land (which happened for ~ 67/792 centroids) we set the distance to shore to 1 meter because it was actually not sampled on land (obviously) and it ended up there only because we simplified transects into straight lines between transect start and end points.


# Distance to port canyon and reserve (Martin) :

# Inside/Outside MPA :

MPA data used : The MPA data used was made in several steps :
 1) 2024 : Lola Romant assigned protection levels to the French Mediterranean MPA based on MPA Guide Categories during her internship. # --> protectionMed_fr_modif.gpkg

 2) This data was then modified by Laure Velez to keep only the MPA with the highest protection level when several were overlapping. 
 --> protectionMed_fr.shp

 3) 07/2025 : Marieke Schultz manually (QGIS) modified the data to correct errors based on current legislation : 
 	- "Passe de la Réserve naturelle de Cerbicale (Bouches De Bonifacio)" : from level 3 to 4
 	- "Passe de l'Archipel des îles de Lavezzi (Bouches De Bonifacio)" : from level 3 to 4
 	- I created the column ‘Fully’ in which levels 1, 2 and 3 are marked “YES” and the rest ‘NO’.
 --> protectionMed_fr_modif.gpkg

# 4) 07/2025 : Laure Velez assigned to each sample whether or not it belonged to a fully protected MPA, using the protectionMed_fr_modif.gpkg data. She checked for each eDNA samples whether or not they belonged to a fully protected MPA, cheking both start point, end point, and transect (eg when start and end points were outside but transect crossing the reserve). 
# --> mtd_mpafully_2018-2024_complete.csv with column "mpa_fully". 


In this section of the code, we assign the variable "mpa_fully" (i.e., whether or not a replicate group was done inside a fully protected area according to MPA Guide definition) to each replicate group. When all samples of the replicate group have mpa_fully = 1 we set buff$mpa_fully = 1, when all samples of the replicate group have mpa_fully = 0 we set buff$mpa_fully = 0, else we set buff$mpa_fully = NA. In mtdt_5 with 788 rows no NA was found. 




# Sampling effort 




# Habitat : 

We use the DONIA expert monitoring network (www.medtrix.fr, “Donia Expert” project), at a ~0.001° resolution, providing spatial coverage of rocky, soft, artificial, and coralligenous substrates, but also of seagrass meadows (Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa sp.), and the associated dead mattes of Posidonia oceanica (what remains when the seagrass is dead). 

The habitat data (bioc_2023_medfr_100m_2154.tif) comes from Andromede updated in 2023. 

Key assumption : habitats did not change from 2018 to 2024.



Important methodological considerations : "Zone bathyale" is not considered as a habitat in this analysis, thus it is ignored when it appears to be the main habitat (we take the next more important habitat) and when counting the number of habitats per km².






# Chlorophyll : 

Mediterranean Sea, Bio-Geo-Chemical, L4, monthly means, daily gapfree and climatology Satellite Observations (1997-ongoing) (https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00300) : 
spatial resolution for chl : 
Temporal resolutions: monthly and daily (for "gap-free" and climatology data)











3_Prep_eDNA.R ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Important methodo consideration : 

Complex handling : 

We have 18 complexes. 

1 was deleted because both species were freshwater species.
In 5 complexes only 1 species was kept because its geographical distribution was mediterranean while the other's were not. 
In 8 complexes were all species could be mediterranean we keep them as a complex. 
In 2 complexes one of the species was also found alone (different halotype). The detections of the species alone and the complexe are merged and we keep them as a complex.
In 2 complexes : Labrus merula.Labrus viridis | Labrus merula.Labrus_viridis.Centrolabrus_melanocercus | Centrolabrus_melanocercus : delete Labrus merula.Labrus viridis.Centrolabrus melanocercus


In the end we have 11 complexe left
